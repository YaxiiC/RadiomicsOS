Radiomics-Integrated Deep Learning with Hierarchical Loss for Osteosarcoma Histology Classification


Osteosarcoma (OS) is an aggressive primary bone malignancy that predominantly affects children and adolescents. Accurate histopathological assessment of viable versus non-viable tumor regions after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is critical for prognosis and treatment planning, yet manual evaluation remains labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to inter-observer variability. Recent advances in digital pathology have enabled automated necrosis quantification; however, most studies rely on small, single-institution datasets. In particular, prior works based on the TCIA OS Tumor Assessment dataset have used random tile-level data splits, introducing information leakage between training and test sets and leading to inflated performance estimates that poorly reflect real-world generalization.

To address these challenges, we propose a multimodal hierarchical learning framework that integrates image features from convolutional or transformer backbones with handcrafted radiomics descriptors, optimized through a structured two-head loss function with learnable uncertainty weighting. By adopting a patient-level split, our approach prevents data leakage, ensuring fair evaluation and greater clinical relevance, while establishing a robust and interpretable foundation for quantitative OS prognostication and treatment guidance.
